MBluetooth Library for Mobile Processing
----------------------------------------

Library to create a default bluetooth service, discover near devices and 
exchange data, is based also in the official release of the bluetooth library
for mobile processing.

This Library can be used also in Processing using a J2SE implementation
of the JSR 82: JavaTM APIs for Bluetooth

This release contains the AvetanaBluetooth implementation for Linux licensed 
under GPL, for more information visit :

 http://sourceforge.net/projects/avetanabt

To use another implementation of the JSR 82 API simply remove the avetanaBT.jar
file from the library directory, edit the export.txt and change the name of 
the jar file

The examples directory contains examples to show library features.

Enjoy!
