  Method lastMesh added to recover the last image, box, sphere, rect, ellipse

  All method to draw image was renamed to sprite, this show the image always 
  facing the user, this can be use to show labels.
  
  Image implementation changed to create a rect mesh with the image like 
  texture. This allows rotate the image and manipulate the image like a MMesh,
  one problems is that the image must hae a size power of 2.
