MPush Library for Mobile Processing
-----------------------------------

The MPush library allows the applications receive asynchronous data, 
as informaction becomes available, instead of forcing the application
to use synchronous polling techniques that increase resource use or latency

The push registry enables MIDlets to set themselves up to be launched automatically,
without user initiation. The push registry manages network- and timer-initiated 
MIDlet activation; that is, it enables an inbound network connection or a timer-based 
alarm to wake a MIDlet up. For example, you can write a workgroup application that 
employs network activation to wake up and process newly received email, or new appointments 
that have been scheduled. Or you can use timer-based activation to schedule your MIDlet 
to synchronize with a server every so often then go to sleep.
