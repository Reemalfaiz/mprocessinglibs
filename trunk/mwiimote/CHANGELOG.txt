MWiimote Library for Mobile Processing - Log
--------------------------------------------

- (2008,02,01) 

  A better way to deliver mousePress and mouseRelease needs to be implemented.

  MWhiteBoardP desktop support added, this allows send mouse events to the 
  desktop host. When the board reads ir data, send a mouse pressed and mouse 
  release event to the desktop.

- (2008,01,31)

  To avoid create all the libraries objects, listen the discover events and 
  create a simple way to discover, calibrate and report data, the class 
  MWhiteBoardP support multiple constructors to allow passing libraries objects
  or create the libraries objects when the board is started. 
  
  A calibration process is implemented to provide a easy way to perform this 
  tasks, needs better messages and some menu.  

  Adding specific implementation of the whiteboard to Processing.

  Adding MWiiControlListener to check ir events from the control. 

  Whiteboard implementation using wiimote, this implementation use a 
  Projector-Camera Homography to calibrate the projection according wiimote 
  data.

  The IR data is initialized to generate correct information the first time 
  that is read.

  Debug attribute added to the MWiimote class to allow print debugging info 
  when necessary.

  Rumble implemented.

  Battery Level implemented.

  Better IR activation, enable and disable works, screen resolution added,
  accelerometer enable and disable works now. 

- (2008,01,25)

  Rename check methods to parse.

  Adding support for IR data: Enable IR and parse data implemented.  

  Update build.xml file to allow publish the library easy.

  Release 0.1

  Issue : 
  
  	When the client close the connection with the proxy some times this don't 
  	fire the event client disconnected.   

  To avoid the problem of receive a lot of packets in the phone, the proxy can 
  be configured to discard an amount of packets. After some tests with a K790 
  phone the default discard value is set to 5 wich means that 1 packet of 5 is 
  send to the server. 

  Testing the proxy client, the wiimote control send a lot of packets with the 
  accelerometer information, this amount of data can be read by a computer but 
  a phone takes more time to read each data. 

- (2008,01,05)

  Adding proxy example to allow connect the control to a mobile phone and 
  mobile client to connect the phone to the control. 
  
  Proxy implementation added to allow a phone to read and write data from a 
  Wiimote control.

- (2008,01,04)

  Example MoveBallP added to show how to read accelerometer values.
  
  Adding accelerometer support, turn on/off, calibrate, read data. 
  
  Adding support for button press event, the application return a mask with 
  the bits of each button pressed, all the eleven buttons are listen.  

  The l2cap problem is not present using the AvetanaBT implementation cause 
  allow open the connection with the wiimote then a Processing version can be 
  create to access the control, also can be use to create a proxy to connect 
  the phone with the Processing proxy, with the control to avoid the problem 
  with phones. 
  
  The wiimote discovery works fine in phones, but when the connections is open 
  a exception "Bad PSM" is throw cause the phone don't support open l2cap 
  connection in ports 0x11 and 0x13 cause are reserved and only availables to 
  the Operative System. 

  Leds change state implemented. 

  This library connect the Wii Remote control with Mobile Processing.

  Initial Import.
