MSynth Library for Mobile Processing - Log
------------------------------------------

- (2007,11,06)

  Method toString added to all the classes.
  
  Streaming example added, this example only works if the phone support 
  streaming audio/x-wav content, if not the midlet try to load all the audio 
  data before play the sound. 

- (2007,11,06)

  MSynth class added to provide global methods like support methos and some 
  constants used by the library. Support example added.

- (2007,11,04)

  Adding stereo example.
  
  Fixing sound duration according the number of channels.
  
  Modulation examples added.
  
  Fixing MSaw generator, period added.
  
  MWaveTable added and table based on wav file added (MWavTable)
  
  MWaveViewer rename to MWaveImage to create an image of the wave generate by
  the parent generator of the component. Example added.
  
  Initial version of the MWaveViewer, component to show a wave generate with 
  the synthesizers.

  Fixing MAdd generator, the vector needs to be created always.
  
  Fixing time update on wave generators, the increment must be set after 
  calculate the current time value.

  Adding more wave operators like subtract and multiplication, a new abstract 
  class is created to support binary operations, cosine example added.

  Triangle and Sawtooth wave generators added, also examples.
  
  MSquare wave generator added, also a sample of use and a sample to save the 
  wav file generate to a file inside the phone.

  The MWave abstract class is created to provide a base class to the different 
  kinds of waves generate by the synth. The MSin generator now is a MWave 
  subclass.

- (2007,11,03)

  Adding A440 and AddHarmonics examples.

- (2007,11,02)

  Value setter and getter added to MConstant.
  
  Basic arquitecture implemented based on Generators and SoundGenerators. The
  current generators are MConstant, MSin like signal generators, MAdd allows 
  signal addition and MWav allows the creation of wav sounds.
  
  The MSynth library allows the creation of synthetized sounds based on signal
  generators like MSin and sound generators like MWav that creates wav files 
  with the generate sounds.
  
  Initial import.
