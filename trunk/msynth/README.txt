MSynth Library for Mobile Processing
------------------------------------

The MSynth library allows the creation of synthesized sounds based on simple 
signal generators, generators that operate over the values of a signal and 
sound generators that create concrete sounds in a known format like WAV. 

The examples directory contains examples to show library features.

Enjoy!
