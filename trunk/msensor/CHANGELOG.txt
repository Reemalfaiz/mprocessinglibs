MSensor Library for Mobile Processing - Log
-------------------------------------------

- (2008,01,08)

  Initial release 0.1, very experimental, never tested in real devices.

  Accelerometer query methods x,y,z rename to accelX, accelY, accelZ, maybe in 
  other version the accelerometer can return some values based on acceleration 
  like speed or angles. 

  Some example documentation.

  The support example throws an java.lang.Error in devices without support, this 
  is cause by the MSensorListener that use a class of the sensor library, a new 
  way to check support must be implemented.  

  Fixing dates. 

- (2007,12,07)

  Conflicts with the MAccelerometer example, ranamed to MAccel.

  Implemented AVAILABLE and UNAVAILABLE sensor events.
  
  To avoid create a new sensor each time a search is perform a sensor cache is 
  created to storage the sensor created in all the searchs.

  MSensorManager.supported() method throws a Class Not Found exception when is 
  call from a sketch. To avoid this issue the listen metodos are provide now 
  by the MSensorListener.
  
  Fixing static member pMIDlet on MSensorManager.

- (2007,12,06)

  MAccelerometer sensor implemented.
  
  MSensorManager class implemented to query the sensor system, MSensor class 
  implemented like super class for every sensor, MSensorListener implemented to
  listen sensor availability.
  
  JSR 256 Sensor API implementation extracted from Nokia Reference 
  Implementation.  

  Initial Import.
