MSensor Library for Mobile Processing
-------------------------------------

The MSensor library allows sketches fetch data from different kind of available
sensor build or connected to the phone. The library is based on the JSR 256 
Mobile Sensor API that allows Java ME application developers to fetch data 
easily and uniformly from sensors. A sensor is any measurement data source.

The current version of the MSensor library allow read data from an 
accelerometer available in some phones like Sony Ericsson W910.  

This library is very experimental and not tested on real phone. 

Enjoy!
