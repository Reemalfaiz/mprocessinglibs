  Encode error Fixed. With the update of the build.xml file the res folder 
  containing the dat files necessary to encode is not added to the library, 
  the build.xml file is updated to add the res folder again. 

  The encode library is returning an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Exception.
  
  Example decodeCapture update to support background decoding.
  
  The library performance depends of phone camera resolution and also the 
  quality of the image and also the type of image to decode. For example 
  when an image without precense of qrcode is decode, the library quickly 
  returns and error, but if the image contains a qrcode far away the library 
  take some time to return a result. 
  
  Fixing background decode.
