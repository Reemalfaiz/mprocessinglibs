------------------------------------

The MZXing library decode QRCodes

The library is a wrapper for the ZXing library available at 
http://code.google.com/p/zxing, the library is licensed under the  Apache 
License, Version 2.0

The library works more quickly than the MQRCode library but this library is 
bigger. 

The MZXing library use the ZXingReader application for the J2ME platform,  
no modifications to the code are made, only to the build process to create a
not obfuscate version of the application.
