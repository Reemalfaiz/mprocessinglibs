  the response like an event.

  The methods getResults added to MResponse and MResult to grab all the results
  with a given name under the xml.

  Initial implementation of the MRest library.
  
  This library allows access to REST services using two objects MRequest to 
  encapsulate the request and MReponse to encapsulate the response.
  
  The MRequest provide the methods to create a REST request using the GET or 
  POST method, creating the query urls or adding the parameters to the POST 
  request.
  
  The XML response is parse using the KXML parser, and grabbing the response in
  a tree struct representing each tag with the name, text and attributes, also 
  provide a xpath implementation to grab the text() and @attribute values for a 
  element provide like a path "/rsp/@stat", also provide access to the elements
  of the response.
  
  The current implementation support GET method only and hav to wait the request 
  until is parse.
