  First Realease 0.1

  ToDO list updated to add some other Mobile Processing instructions to 
  implement.

  README.txt updated to give a brief description of the library and show how 
  to run the examples.

  Simple examples added to test each method : 
  loadImage, loadBytes, loadStrings, saveBytes, isSupported and listRoots.

  saveBytes, saveStrings fixed, must create the file if not exists.
  
  loadBytes implementation bug fixed, the file size is returned by fileSize,
  the totalSize returns the size of the storage system.

  MFile will be used to create objects that represents file objects.

  MFile renamed to MFiles.

  Some examples are need, also a guide to create roots, publish files.

  All features needs to be test.

  EVENT_ROOT_ADDED and EVENT_ROOT_REMOVED implemented but jikes fails when the 
  class implements the FileSystemListener, this feature needs revision.

  isSupported, listRoots added.

  loadImage, loadBytes, loadStrings, saveBytes, saveStrings mobile processing
  primitives implemented using file access API (JSR 75).

  Initial implementation of the file access library.
